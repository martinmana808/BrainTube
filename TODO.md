- Search should not always be there 'open'. Should be the magnifying glass icon, click, and then the input opens, or something like that. 
- Theme selector Dark/Bright
- Add video, add channel, add category should be nicer buttons. 
- Explorer column should have padding at the bottom so if you scroll to the bottom, the floating settings button is not overlaying.
